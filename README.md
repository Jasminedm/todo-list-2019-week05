(![Slot Machine](siteSnip.jpg))

This is a basic slot machine game you can play, win and loose! The user begins with a $500 budget and the options to make $5, $50 and $100 bets. If the user makes a bet and doesnt win the bet is subtracted from their total. If the user wins, the bet amount is doubled and added back into their total. The user is not permitted to make a bet larger than their remaining budget. Enjoy!

Skills: HTML / JS
