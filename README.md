<h3>How I made this</h3><br>
<h4>This project uses three buttons and to operate the list. The add next item button is programmed to create a new list input and checkbox for as many items as a user may need to use. The done button is used only for when each task has been checked off. This button will only respond if all items are checked and deliver an encouraging message for completing task. Lastly the clear all task button is used to do exactly that and clear all task so the user can start over. Each button is programmed to a function allowing them to perform these task in JS.</h4>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3><br>
<hr>
<h4>This project taught me how to use JS to create elements as needed instead of hard coding them into my html. This will be a useful skill and concept when building applications for multiple users with multiple needs.<?h4>
